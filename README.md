# Project Title & Overview
The Flutter BMI Calculator App is a mobile application designed to assist users in calculating their Body Mass Index (BMI). Users input their height, weight, and gender, and the app computes the BMI, providing a corresponding result based on established BMI categories. This documentation serves as a guide for understanding the project structure, implementation details, and usage instructions.


## Key Features:
- BMI Calculation: The app allows users to input their height and weight. Using the BMI formula, the app calculates the BMI and categorizes it into different ranges (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight).

- User Input: Users can enter their height and weight using interactive input fields. Additionally, they can specify their gender to improve the accuracy of the BMI calculation.

- Result Presentation: The app presents the calculated BMI along with a corresponding result, indicating whether the user is underweight, has a normal weight, is overweight, or falls into other BMI categories.

- Interactive UI: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience for individuals of all skill levels.
## Project Structure:


- Input Screen: Contains the UI components for users to input their height, weight, and select their gender.

- BMI Calculation Logic: Implements the algorithm for calculating BMI based on user input.

- Result Screen: Displays the calculated BMI and the corresponding result based on established BMI categories.

- User Interface Components: Various UI components are utilized to create an interactive and visually appealing experience for the user.

- Dependencies: Lists external dependencies, such as the Flutter framework and any additional packages used in the project.
## Getting Started:
- Download and Install: Ensure Flutter is installed on your development environment. Clone the project repository and download any required dependencies using the Flutter package manager.

- Configuration: No additional configuration is required. The app is designed to be plug-and-play for BMI calculations.

- Build and Run: Follow standard Flutter development procedures to build and run the app on your desired platform (iOS or Android).
